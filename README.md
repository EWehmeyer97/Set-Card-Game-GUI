Files and Directories:
	In the project repository are multiple draft and console versions as indicated by the file name. There is also a base timer implementation that did not make the final version of the game.

	In the Set directory are all of the files associated with our GUI
	implementation

	It also includes the algorithm implementation for the game

Program Purpose:
	This program implements the game of SET based on the wiki rules provided in the Project 2 description.

	In addition to the base requirements for this project, our team chose to implement the following additional features:
		1) A graphical user interface (GUI)
		2) A Hint feature which will tell the user one of the sets in 	   the game
		3) The location for a timer (though it is not functioning at this point)
		
Command Line Arguments (after the repository has been cloned):
	rubymine Set

	#At this point rubymine should open and you only need to select "run"
	to start the game.
	
	#To Run the GUI version of the program, a gem must be installed. To do this type the 	following command:
	
	gem install --local Project-1-The-Cool-Coding-Kids/Set/set/set-0.0.6.gem

	#to run after this, type into the console

	set.rb
